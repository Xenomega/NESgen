# NESgen
Static Recompilation of NES ROMs to C
 - Created for Compilers & Interpreters @ University of Toronto.  
 - Not meant to be a practical emulator, rather explore the increased complexity of statically recompiling, explaining why it is not always possible, and why traditional emulation approaches such as interpretation or dynamic recompilation are preferred.  
 - It's a recompiler that gets to explore emulation, disassembly, and operating systems.  
 - Intended to support some test ROMs from: https://www.castledragmire.com/hynes/reference/resource/index.html  
 - Has very limited production ROM support.
